			<h3>Caption: Two possible future. Colors are 2100 temperatures under "business as usual" climate change (left, RCP8.5) and aggressive climate policy (right, RCP2.6). Burke, Hsiang, & Miguel (Nature 2015) demonstrate the effects of these changes on economies around the world. These findings are used in a simulation of future nightlights, as seen from space, since richer economies tend to glow brighter. A hotter world is a more unequal world, with the north benefitting and tropical economies declining. A cooler world leads to more equitable global growth, offering regions like Africa the chance to "catch up".
